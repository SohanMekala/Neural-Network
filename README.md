Solving the famous XOr problem with a Neural Netwrok

XOr(exclusive or) is a boolean operation that returns true(1) only if the two supplied inputs differ. For example, it returns 1 if inputs [0, 1] are provided, and it returns 0 if inputs [1,1] are provided. Fundamentally, XOr is not linearly seperable, making it a problem that can only be solved by a model that can analyze complex, non-linear relationships.
